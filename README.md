The code analyzes a web server log file to pull out key details. It counts how many requests each IP address made, figures out the most accessed endpoint, and flags suspicious activity based on failed login attempts. The results are saved in two formats: a CSV file for structured data and a log file. It uses regular expressions to extract data, organizes it with Python dictionaries, and outputs everything in a clear way.
